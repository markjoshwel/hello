# joshwel.dev

Source files for my personal website that I host using GitHub Pages.

## Building

```shell
npm run build  # build css using tailwind
npm run clean  # clean css using postcss+cssnano
```

## Deploying

As the target deployment platform is GitHub pages, the root of the page should be the
`/docs` folder.

## Notice

I personally use Decima Mono Pro as my font of choice for my website. However due to
licensing, I am not able to distribute it here.

- `docs/font-regular.woff2`
- `docs/font-bold.woff2`
- `docs/font-italic.woff2`

If adapting the source code of this project to your own website, adjust the
`src/main.css` file as deemed neccesary. If so, you may also wish to adjust the
`.gitignore` as needed also.

## License
